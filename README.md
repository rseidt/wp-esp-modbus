# wp-modbus-mqtt

This project provides a bridge between Modbus devices and MQTT, specifically designed for integration with heat pumps. It is compatible with both ESP32 and ESP8266 microcontrollers, allowing flexible deployment on popular IoT hardware.

**Hardware Requirement:**  
To connect to Modbus devices, you will need an RS485 TTL bridge.

**License Notice:**  
Some minor parts of the code are based on [gmasse/esp-modbus-mqtt](https://github.com/gmasse/esp-modbus-mqtt), which is licensed under GPL 3. As a result, this project is currently also distributed under the GPL 3 license. Once all third-party code is replaced with original implementations, the project will be relicensed under a more permissive terms (MIT/Apache 2).
